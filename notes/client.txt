Client App
=========================================
-client app will be a small set of scripts on our local machine.
-these scripts will perform the intake of all credit files.
-credit files will be parsed for all information and that information 
will then be sent to the DB server for storage.
-This method ensures raw credit files never leave our local machine.


TBD
=========================================
-should each client be assigned a reference number?
    -ref# will be consistent on DB server and on local machine
    -ref# can be used to further query DB server about individual Skip
-How to do error handling/logging?
-Option to view the structured data before it is blasted off to server?
-Save structured data on local machine to confirm its correct?


Scripts
=========================================
-credit file parsing script
    -bs4 with open()
    -loop through files and create the structured JSON data
        -list of dictionaries
-HMAC signing script
    -secret key storage is main issue here
    -HMAC headers will be different from Django style
-data transfer script
    -use HTTPS to send HMAC-signed data to protected endpoint on server


Interface
=========================================
command line


Data Transfer
=========================================
-use python requests library
-HTTPS POST request
-structured JSON data


Security
=========================================
-HTTPS
-HMAC
-Storage for private key:
    -encrypted file
    -at runtime script prompts user for pw
        -getpass python module
    -pw success decrypts file containing HMAC key /other sensitive shit
